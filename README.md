## Simple Deep Neural Network Implementation in python

> In this project I implemented a Deep Neural Network following Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Course [Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://www.coursera.org/learn/neural-networks-deep-learning?specialization=deep-learning).
> This will be further improved after I finish second course of specialization
